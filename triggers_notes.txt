Triggers included in schema.sql:

1) tr_admission_insert
   - After inserting an admission, increments the occupied_beds count for the assigned room.

2) tr_admission_update
   - After updating an admission from 'Admitted' to 'Discharged', decrements the occupied_beds value.

3) tr_inventory_update
   - After inventory updates, if quantity falls below reorder_level, inserts a notification row.

4) tr_appointment_insert
   - After inserting an appointment that occurs within the next 24 hours, inserts a notification (demo).

Notes:
- Notifications table is a lightweight demo to capture automated events. In production, you'd forward these to
  a notification service, message queue, or email/sms gateway.
- Triggers are MySQL-style. For PostgreSQL, use PL/pgSQL syntax and CREATE FUNCTION + CREATE TRIGGER.
